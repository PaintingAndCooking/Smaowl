		<h2>What Paints Should I Use?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="font-size:30px;">Paint is made by mixing a pigment (colored powder) with a medium (liquid substance) such as water. Egg is the medium for tempera painting, linseed oil for oil painting, and acrylic resin for acrylic painting. In fresco wall paintings, pigments are applied to wet plaster. Watercolors are made by mixing pigments with a water-soluble binder such as gum.</p>
